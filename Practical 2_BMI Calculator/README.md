[Submission Link](https://github.com/akhilManipal/bmiCalculator)

## Exercise Objective:
Create an Android app that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and determines the weight category.

## Problem Statement:
The app should have two input fields for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Upon pressing the "Calculate BMI" button, the app should display the BMI value and the corresponding weight category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).

## Instructions:
- Ensure your code is well-commented to enhance readability.
- Adhere to proper naming conventions for variables and other elements in your code.
- Your code should compile without any errors, warnings, or deprecations.
- Minimize the use of unnecessary whitespaces including newlines, spaces, and tabs.
- Thoroughly test your code before submission to ensure it functions as expected.

## Expected Output:
The app displays the BMI value and the corresponding weight category.

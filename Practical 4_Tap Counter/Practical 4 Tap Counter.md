# Practical 3: To-Do List App

## Exercise Objective:
Develop an Android application that counts the number of taps on a button and displays the count.

## Problem Statement:
Create an app with a button labeled "Tap me!" and a TextView to display the count of taps. Each time the button is tapped, the count should increase by one.

## Instructions:
- Ensure your code is well-commented to enhance readability.
- Adhere to proper naming conventions for variables and other elements in your code.
- Your code should compile without any errors, warnings, or deprecations.
- Minimize the use of unnecessary whitespaces including newlines, spaces, and tabs.
- Thoroughly test your code before submission to ensure it functions as expected.

## Expected Output:
The app displays the number of times the button has been tapped.

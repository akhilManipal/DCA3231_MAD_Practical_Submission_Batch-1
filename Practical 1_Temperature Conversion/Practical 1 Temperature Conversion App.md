# Practical 1: Temperature Conversion App

## Exercise Objective:
Develop a simple Android application that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

## Problem Statement:
Create an app with a single input field for the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. Upon pressing a "Convert" button, the app should display the converted temperature in Fahrenheit.

## Instructions:
- Ensure your code is well-commented to enhance readability.
- Adhere to proper naming conventions for variables and other elements in your code.
- Your code should compile without any errors, warnings, or deprecations.
- Minimize the use of unnecessary whitespaces including newlines, spaces, and tabs.
- Thoroughly test your code before submission to ensure it functions as expected.

## Expected Output:
The app displays the temperature in Fahrenheit after conversion.

|------|------|------|
|1 |	0 |	32.0°F|
|2 |	100 |	212.0°F|
|3 |	-40 |	-40.0°F|
|4 |	37 |	98.6°F|
|5 |	25 |	77.0°F|
|6 |	-10 |	14.0°F|
|7 |	50 |	122.0°F|
|8 |	30 |	86.0°F|
|9 |	-20 |	-4.0°F|
|10 |	15 |	59.0°F|

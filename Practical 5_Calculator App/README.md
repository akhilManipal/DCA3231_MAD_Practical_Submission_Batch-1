# Practical 5: Calculator App

## Exercise Objective:
Create a simple Android calculator app that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Problem Statement:
The app should have two input fields for entering numbers and buttons for each of the four arithmetic operations. Upon selecting an operation and pressing the "Calculate" button, the app should display the result.

## Instructions:
- Ensure your code is well-commented to enhance readability.
- Adhere to proper naming conventions for variables and other elements in your code.
- Your code should compile without any errors, warnings, or deprecations.
- Minimize the use of unnecessary whitespaces including newlines, spaces, and tabs.
- Thoroughly test your code before submission to ensure it functions as expected.

## Expected Output:
The app displays the result of the arithmetic operation.
